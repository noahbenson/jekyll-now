My research examines the organization of human perceptual information in the
brain and how that organization is related to the brain's anatomical shape. I
have a strong interest in neuroscientific knowledge representation and data
sharing, and my work deals heavily with large datasets such as the [Human
Connectome Project](https://db.humanconnectome.org/). I work primarily with the
visual system.
