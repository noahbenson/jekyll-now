I'm a senior data scientist and data science fellow at the [University
of Washington](https://washington.edu/)'s [eScience
Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/) in Seattle. I'm broadly
interested in neuro-informatics and neuroscience-related data
representation; in particularl I work on human vision and its
representation in the brain. My work deals with how the anatomical
structure of the brain is related to visual experience. For more
information about my research, see my
[Research]({{site.baseurl}}/research/) page or my [Curriculum
Vitae]({{site.baseurl}}/cv/).
